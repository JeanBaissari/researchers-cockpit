## Answer

Looking at the Zipline-Reloaded repository structure, there are several relevant files that suggest Zipline does have infrastructure for handling various trading sessions:

1. src/zipline/data/bcolz\_minute\_bars.py \- The minute bar writer implementation  
2. src/zipline/data/fx/ \- FX data handling (which deals with 24-hour markets)  
3. exchange\_calendars integration via exchange\_info.py

The documentation claim appears to be incorrect or outdated. Zipline-Reloaded uses exchange\_calendars which does support 24/7 calendars (e.g., CRYPTO or custom calendars).

### Proposed Solution

1	Verify the actual error \- The issue is likely not Zipline itself, but how the bundle is configured. The CRYPTO calendar from exchange\_calendars should work if sessions are properly defined.  
2\.	Use proper calendar configuration:

* Ensure exchange\_calendars version supports 24/7 sessions  
* Configure the calendar with continuous sessions (no breaks)

3\.	Alternative: Use HDF5 storage \- hdf5\_daily\_bars.py exists as an alternative to bcolz which may handle edge cases better.  
4\.	Update status to:  
   \*\*Status:\*\* NEEDS INVESTIGATION \- Zipline-Reloaded supports 24/7 calendars via exchange\_calendars.  
   Issue may be in bundle configuration, not Zipline core.  
The agent should re-test with properly configured exchange\_calendars CRYPTO calendar before declaring this unresolved.
