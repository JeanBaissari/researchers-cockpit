## Why This Happens

The exchange\_calendars library's session-related methods (like sessions\_in\_range()) expect Date objects at midnight because trading sessions are defined as full calendar days. When you pass intraday timestamps like 2024-06-03 13:30:00, the library accepts them but warns they're being truncated to 2024-06-03 00:00:00.This occurs during bundle ingestion when the code attempts to validate that data falls within valid trading sessions — a check designed for daily data that doesn't translate cleanly to intraday bars.

## Viable Solutions (Ranked)

### Current approach: Skip calendar filtering for intraday (Acceptable but less robust)

This works but loses the validation that data falls on actual trading days — potentially allowing ingestion of data for market holidays.

## Recommendation Assessment

Based on the Zipline-Reloaded structure, this is likely an architectural design error in your implementation, not a Zipline limitation.

### Why?

1. Zipline-Reloaded has dedicated intraday handling: The codebase includes \_minute\_bar\_internal.pyx, bcolz\_minute\_bars.py, and minute bar writers specifically designed for intraday data.  
2. Proper separation exists: Zipline distinguishes between daily bar readers/writers (bar\_reader.py, bcolz\_daily\_bars.py) and minute bar infrastructure — they use different storage and different calendar interactions.  
3. The warning suggests misuse: You're likely passing minute bar timestamps to APIs designed for daily session validation. Zipline's minute bar writers handle calendar integration differently — they validate against trading minutes, not sessions.

### What You Likely Missed

Your bundle ingestion code is probably:

* Using daily bar ingestion patterns for intraday data  
* Calling session-level calendar APIs when you should be using minute-level calendar methods  
* Not leveraging Zipline's native MinuteBarWriter which already handles this correctly

### Recommended Investigation

Check if your intraday ingestion uses:

* BcolzMinuteBarWriter (correct) vs custom daily-style logic (incorrect)  
* calendar.minutes\_for\_sessions\_in\_range() vs calendar.sessions\_in\_range()

The fix isn't suppressing warnings — it's using Zipline's minute bar infrastructure correctly.
