# Minute Scalping Strategy Hypothesis

## The Belief
Short-term price fluctuations around a stable moving average in highly liquid equities can be profitably exploited by entering trades when prices deviate and quickly reverting when they return.

## The Reasoning
Minor deviations from short-term averages often represent temporary supply/demand imbalances that tend to correct quickly, especially in active markets. Scalping aims to capture these small, frequent movements.

## The Conditions
This strategy is expected to perform best in liquid, moderately volatile markets with tight spreads, where quick order execution is possible. It may struggle in illiquid, highly volatile, or trending markets where price reversals are less predictable or slower.

## The Falsification
If the strategy exhibits a negative average trade return or a win rate below 40% over a 1-month minute-frequency backtest, the hypothesis is considered false. Significant slippage or commission costs rendering the strategy unprofitable would also falsify it.
