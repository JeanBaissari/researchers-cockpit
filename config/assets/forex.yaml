  # Backtesting notes
  notes: |
    - Forex trades 24/5 (closes Friday 17:00 EST, opens Sunday 17:00 EST)
    - Use appropriate calendar (FOREX) not equity calendar
    - Spreads widen during low liquidity (Asian session, news events)
    - Major pairs have tighter spreads than exotic pairs
    - Leverage magnifies both gains and losses
    - Consider rollover/swap rates for overnight positions
    - Session overlaps (London/NY) have highest liquidity
