# Planning

### PLANNING.md
**Project-Level Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive project understanding

**MANDATORY CREATION**: If PLANNING.md doesn't exist inside the [[ID_[000]]CUSTOMIZED_TASK_FOLDER], create it immediately before any major project work. Example: If the plan is about a creating a series of admin components for an e-commerce, the planning would be placed inside a folder such as/'[TASK_FOLDER]/001_ADMIN_COMPONENTS', it would be named /PLANNING.md and should contain every major detail describing the component integration and how it should be handled so other agents can disect each section into multiple individual tasks. Each planning file should not be longer than 400 lines during initial draft, otherwise refactor into multiple different planning files. 

**REQUIRED STRUCTURE**:
