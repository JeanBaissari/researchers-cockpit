Important Integration Points:

* Pandas Integration: Zipline's data.history() returns pandas DataFrames, making seamless integration possible  
* NumPy Optimization: Convert pandas DataFrames to NumPy arrays for performance-critical computations  
* Visualization: Use matplotlib in the analyze() function or in Jupyter notebooks for result visualization  
* Performance Metrics: Empyrical-reloaded provides standardized financial metrics that complement Zipline's built-in analytics  
* Machine Learning: Scikit-learn models can be trained on historical data and used within strategies for signal generation

These libraries are typically imported and used directly within strategy functions, analysis scripts, or Jupyter notebooks, creating a powerful ecosystem for algorithmic trading research.
